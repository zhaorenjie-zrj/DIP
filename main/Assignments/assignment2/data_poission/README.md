# Assignment 2 - DIP with PyTorch

### In this assignment, you will implement traditional DIP (Poisson Image Editing) and deep learning-based DIP (Pix2Pix) with PyTorch.

### 1. Implement Poisson Image Editing with PyTorch.

## Running

To run data_possin, run:

```basic
python assign2_1.py
```
```

## Results (need add more result images)
### data_poission
()


### 2. Pix2Pix implementation.
See [Pix2Pix subfolder](Pix2Pix/).
